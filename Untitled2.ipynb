    "text='My name David Kochalski. I was born in a small town called , and I was born May 5, 1928.  Well, we were very hard working, six children, father and mother and we had a small mill, flour, buckwheat. We were not prosperous but comfortable.  I went to two schools. One was a public school in the morning. In the afternoon I went to a religious school until almost late at night.  Yes.  Well, I raised in the spirit of Judaism.  No, the school itself, in this little city, was segregated between Catholics and Jews. Mind you, it was a small town, and I would say the majority of the people in that small town were Jewish people. Inside the town, somehow, I don\\'t know why, but they separated us Jewish children and Catholic children. As you know, most of the people in Poland were Catholic.  Yes, I used to have friends.  Yes, I did. I felt it, maybe not personally, but I knew of a lot of incidents whereby either they were small little -- I would call it -- we were separated, in other words, but hardly got together, and there were incidents. Incidents, not pleasant incidents, because we were    called in from the house, people regardless of how religious we were, did not believe that we were really religious people.  No, other than we were a lovely family.  Yes there were Zionists in the city. There were Socialists, there were Communists, even  though at that time Communists had to go underground, and religious institutions.  My parents were, I would say, Zionists, and very religious.  I was aware what was going on even though I was a very young youngster. My father used to subscribe to many newspapers, Jewish in origin and non-Jewish papers, papers that had nothing to do with us. However, my father and my brother and all the rest of them we used to discuss those things. They used to discuss and I used to listen, and I knew what was going on. In fact, I remember when they were chasing out Jews from Germany, who were of Polish origin, my father took in some of them, a couple of them, to stay with them because they came out of there with nothing. They really went from city to city amongst Jews. There were so many of them that people had to help. So, I was aware, until the war, very much aware, what was going on.  Definitely, yes. In a public school, since it was more or less a Jewish school, in other words, we did not speak Jewish there, it was Polish, history, everything was Polish, and the guy who was --what do you call it? He was not Polish, the guy who was running the school, he was not Jewish, he was Polish. In other words, he was a Catholic, so we were aware amongst us kids, because sometimes we were not greeted in the city very well.  Yes, because people were aware that eventually Hitler will overrun Poland. It was known between people that he\\'s not going to stop at that time in Czechoslovakia. He had great -- in other words, he had great expansion ideas, and he asked the Polish government to give him almost everything they needed, or wanted. So, we knew it was going to be sooner or later. A few days before the war they already had black outs in Poland, because at that time, I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement. It was  about a week before the war, and everyone was aware that there will be a war. We did not know the particulars of what they signed. The Germans, the USSR, we anticipated there would be a war.  I don\\'t think so. The Jewish people naturally were very anxious. They already knew what happened to the people. They were thrown out. They already heard of the burnings of the synagogues and everything, but they really thought it will pass if the Germans come in. It will pass, and Jewish people really believed that Germany was going to be defeated. We were aware and the preparation was made in a way. People used to hoard food and everything, because they knew he was going to come. They had certain memories, Jewish people had certain memories of World War I where it really was benign. They occupied Poland or part of Poland and it was benign. In other words, the occupation, they were not harsh on Jews. On the other end, Jews were very friendly because our language, the Jewish language resembled German, so there were a lot of Germans in that town. They used to speak Jewish too, or Jews spoke German. So, the Jews kind of figured it will go over. Maybe the war will take a little longer, but it\\'s not going to be that bad. They did not expect anything very bad.  At that time, it was more or less, I would say a partnership between Jews and Catholics, because they had a history, the catholics had a bad history of German occupations. The Jews already knew what was going to happen, that they are putting Jews in concentration camps and so on. That they are really against Jews, the Germans. So, naturally at that point they were united.  What I remember is one morning, I think it was on a Friday, we were all sleeping and all of a sudden, a great bang in that little town. A bomb was thrown. We did not know it was a bomb. We all ran out and we saw planes going over. There was near the town, not far from the town were German garrison (ph). They tried to bomb the garrison but they missed. They bombed the city. At that time, radios whatever you could hear, they announced already that the war had begun.  No, it was a Polish Army garrison, which from what I guess, they wanted to bomb, but they probably missed.  Panic, immediately. There was great panic in town. People did not know what to do, to stay in that little town or escape to Warsaw. My parents they went to Warsaw. All the six children and my mother. My father was in the militia. He was a young man. They took him in the militia to watch black outs. Once the German planes came they either threw out -- they didn\\'t throw them out, but they let go certain soldiers in parachutes. His aim, my father\\'s aim, was to watch that a black outs and there were some people who came in there to bomb some bridges. So my father was there, and my mother was in Warsaw. Finally, my mother got very lonely or she was afraid that something was going to happen to my father, since he wasn\\'t far, so she took me and we went back to that little city. Warsaw at that time was not spared, but they did not come yet, the Germans.  I went back with that little city. My mother stayed with my father, otherwise he was in the Reserves, the Military Reserves, but she watched after him and I was around there and watched after the mill, which we had.  Yes. I stayed there. All of sudden we heard that Warsaw was surrounded, and here my mother and father were very anxious because five children were there. We heard that the Germans surrounded them and the artillery is going, and there was no food because there were more than a million people in Warsaw. My father and mother decided that I should go back to Warsaw to help the children. So, they loaded me up with flour, food, but it was very tough, tough for me.  I had to take some food to help because starvation in Warsaw my mother and father heard about. And you know, they have four children left helter skeltor in Warsaw in a small room. So, they loaded me up with all kinds of food and they said, maybe he\\'ll make it even though Warsaw was surrounded. It was very heavy what they put on, and I remember my father and mother, my mother would say to my father, maybe we\\'ll never see him again. But I guess the urge to help the children was greater and my father kind of looked at me and probably thought the same way, will I go through it, because there were horses and people on the street massacred, killed on the way to Warsaw. In other words, out of town the Germans would also throw in a bomb, artillery, bombed it. Many people would walk through the streets going to Warsaw you would see carnage. So, my mother kind of kissed me and says who knows if I\\'ll ever see him to my father, and my father clenched his hand and I turned around and I walked. I never saw them again.  Well, I came back from Warsaw, that same day Warsaw capitulated. I want to tell you first. I made it into Warsaw. It was very hard. It was very hard, but when I came Warsaw was surrounded there was a time they had what you call -- they stopped fighting to collect the dead. The Germans were fighting the Poles, the Polish Army. They were surrounding them and of course, the Polish Army had some fierce resistance. However, there was a time when they got the Red Cross or whatever, they arranged a one hour to get the dead out of the way. Germans and Polish. At that time, kids like us could go through. I made it and somehow when I came to a certain bridge, since they bombarded the bridge with artillery, I had flour in the bag and a piece of shrapnel went in there. The flour, we got out of it, but we had other food. The flour went on the floor and I made it and I brought it to my brother and sisters, because there was starvation. Artillery, there were people killed, burned, fire was all over. However, the Poles at that time they put up a tremendous heroic, what do you call it -- heroic resistance.  I think I remember I was 12 years old.  Not far.  Only walking.  It didn\\'t take a day, I want you to know, because the carnage on the way was great. The artillery we had to go at midnight. Somehow I think it took two and half, three days until I made it in. It was like an inferno. Warsaw was an inferno.  What do you think? I certainly was frightened.  I was frightened because there were fires and we never knew running through the street  whether the building would collapse. And on top of it, since I was a little boy, after delivery I was told by the Polish Army, and rightly so, to help dig ditches in case the  Germans advance. They called anybody who could do something. I was frightened, that\\'s the answer.  I helped do what?  The Army in Warsaw was preparing ditches against tanks, in case they advanced so any able bodied, any kid, anybody that could see on the street, they made him come and do it.  A party of one.  Well, there was starvation, and the worst thing there was no water. We were hiding in basements. It was really mayhem. People would stand in line for bread, and artillery would just mow them down and kill them. It was an inferno, fires all over. The funny thing, it was during the Jewish holiday, but Jews no matter what it is, what is was, whoever had enough religious upbringing would hide in the underground and have the services. Some of them stayed down there and were buried alive by the artillery. Not just artillery, but planes, where they would just circle the city and fire whoever they saw or just at random at any building.  I don\\'t think so. No, I was impatient. I would have liked to go back, but somehow -- I  had other problems. We had no water and there was a river and we were all running for water, to drink water. That\\'s a very terrible deal when you have no water, and it was also  very dangerous because there were not the Germans. At that time they were shooting the people who came for water. So, some of them never came back. I was very little.  Well, certainly. It wasn\\'t shooting especially, it was bombarding, you know from the air. I either get trapped or I ran away. If I get trapped, then I wait there.  Jewish people were very scared at that time. I think, or I heard that most of the bombardment at that time was directed to the Jewish quarter, most of the bombardment and I guess Jews were very much congregated in one area and the Germans were aware -- in fact they were aware of everything, but this in Warsaw.  Yes, I was hiding in the Jewish area wherever I could.  I think it was very much -- there were cold sufferers and they used to meet at the river if they get water, and it didn\\'t make at that point in time, it didn\\'t make any difference whether you were Jewish, Polish, catholic. At that point we were all Poles against the Germans. I want you to know the Jews were more interested to fight the Germans because they knew that they anticipated bad days.  At the time of bombardment, I think there was no animosity against each other because there was normally a one enemy, which had to be scared of. There was no real animosity. People would stand in line for bread whether they were Poles, Catholics, Jews or anybody else. Each one was miserable.  Not really, only after the war. It always changed later on.  I did not experience anything like that.  Let me tell you. As soon as the armistice was declared, the same day I picked up -- the rest of the children were still in Warsaw -- I picked up and got through the line, because even though there was an armistice, you didn\\'t cross the line, the Germans. However, children they let through, and we went through, and we went up a few kilometers and all of sudden I found out what really happened. I went with another friend. He was not Jewish, he was Catholic. We went back to the city and there was a German sentry and he called over because I did not know that they had at that time a curfew in the middle of the night. So, the German soldier just grabbed me and slashed his throat. So, I understood right now that I have a lot of worries watching myself. In the morning I walked. I  couldn\\'t go at night, in the evening. It took me another day to get through to see if I can meet my parents. In the front of the city I had an uncle. He had a little restaurant. I walked into this restaurant, nobody there. I got into that little city and all of a sudden I see people that don\\'t want to talk to me. Everytime I ask someone you know where are my parents, they took off. That kind of feeling, maybe they escaped. So, I went into that little mill and people were robbing and I was just sitting until a man came over, a huge man, and he said \"These people are robbing this kid. He\\'s just an orphan.\" I didn\\'t understand him. Then my uncle came in and he says to me \"Don\\'t you know about  ,\" that\\'s the time I got immediately, and I couldn\\'t believe it. I asked him where is it that they -- they are digging. I ran over and there was -- they were trying to dig for the people. They were just not my parents, there were bombs and maybe thirty people, twenty-five people in my uncle\\'s restaurant\\'s basement that were all killed. They were all decimated. I took out and I recognized the skull and half of my father\\'s clothes, a little bit of my mother. I got very sick, and I walked out, then I knew for sure that I didn\\'t have any parents anymore. I got sick and dizzy and they took me to the hospital. Then, of course, they were buried in a certain place. A few days later they took the remains of all the people and I came there and I made a mark so I can find it and well it comes later when I go fifty years later. That\\'s how I met my parents again.  The armistice from the beginning it was about 30 days, the whole war, and mind you, from what I found out there were killed about 36 hours before the armistice they were bombed.  Yes, uncle, aunt, and other family, cousins.  Not all, but most.  Well, I was there, no communication with the children. They came about a week later and of course, we didn\\'t know what to do. We were orphans.  I happened to be the third. We were six. I was the third.  We didn\\'t know what to do, and we were very depressed. Somehow, we found also our apartment was bombed. We had to go ina little room. My sister had nothing to survive on -- my sister tried to make some food for people. Sometimes German soldiers used to come by and she would make some food for them in order to earn something. We stayed there, what I remember is all of a sudden my sister disappeared, and we were left. I did not know why, and I was very mad at her. But later I found out that the German soldiers tried to attack her. She was then, I think she was 17 years old. She was six years older than me, so she just took off one day, and run abroad to Russia. See, the Russians took half of Poland, and the Germans took the other one. This was the real pact, the map which separated Poland. So, my sister took off, somehow at that time it was chaos. Anybody who could run across even though -- it wasn\\'t easy, but she made it.  They tried, yes, but she was ashamed to tell us, and she escaped, and she left us five in that city. She was the cook. Again, we were out of business I think about two months.  We had to get out of there, out of the city.  I really don\\'t know. Maybe she was just afraid, I don\\'t know. I asked her and she would never tell me, because she lives in San Francisco. I keep on asking.  In which city?  The people were still there, all of them, except those who were hurt by the bombs or those who escaped to Warsaw. There were more or less -- it was right after the war and they did not suffer too much. We suffered because we were orphans.  It was just everyone for himself.  We got together the first night, my brothers and sisters, went back to Warsaw, and me and my little brother were left behind we could sell anything we had, and then we went to Warsaw. We all went to Warsaw. And of course, there was no place to be. It was already around December. Somehow my older brother, who was a university student got together with this professor to place us in an orphanage. He couldn\\'t take care of us either. He was about 19 years old. So, he took us over. He had another one by the name of Adolf Therman who was the head of the Health and Children.  I don\\'t know. I knew him by the name of Adolf, because eventually I worked with him in Ghetto. They took us over across to place, at that time, and they separated my two little sisters. Also, at the place there was a place for girls and me and my younger brother over there. My older brother suffered probably  , and I don\\'t remember how he was existing, but later on I think he had a job.  It was close to January already. I\\'m sorry the exact dates I just don\\'t know. I could know if I could concentrate.  It was a big building, many children over there. It was an organized like a government inside the orphanage. Each one had his own supposed to do certain things. They had a court, they had people older people who took care of the youngsters to see that they washed, they cleaned. There were people who had to make up the beds. It was just like an internal -- they had a court, if someone deviated from certain things, he was punished.  The doctor was just going around. He knew that you\\'re going to do it right. However, I personally was a rebel in this, because most of the kids were just orphans since they were children. They knew their ways. I was very bitter. I was bitter that all of sudden my father used to care about orphans, and all of a sudden I\\'m an orphan. So, I did not go according to regulations. I used to run away to my brother\\'s all the time, and I did not -- I would say I was not a good boy there.  We used to get jobs, you know, cleaning dishes. Cleaning . I don\\'t remember. I don\\'t recall, but I tried to get away from it because I was not used to the kids  and them with the routines. To me it wasn\\'t routine. It was like punishment.  I was not punished, in fact they made me part of the court, because I was an older boy. Somehow, the regimentation down there, I wasn\\'t too respected because I was fresh one, you know. But they tried to give me some responsibilities.  I really can\\'t recall, but I would say it was over a hundred.  Oh yes, with the older ones. We had beds of 30 to 40 in a room, and we had to have friends at night. We tried to get into mischief. I know now, kids are mischievous. On  the signal to go to sleep, we pretended we were going to sleep, but we used to talk a lot. I had friends.  Well, let me tell you, mostly child talk, because these children down there, they were raised differently. I was born, I mean I was raised and I spoke Yiddish quite a bit, but they spoke Polish only. Their vision of life was different because he taught them  he really taught them discipline. They were schooled and schooled in certain areas, they were way ahead of me. A few friends I had.  Well, from what I know now, officially we\\'re not supposed to have schooling. There was no schooling any more, no school outside, but inside there were certain people who worked there for years and they were teachers and they gave us lesson. I wouldn\\'t say that I attended them, but I did.  First of all the food. I appreciated the food because three times a day we were eating. It was just the beginning of the war. America was not at war then and they used to ship from Switzerland or from other areas, they used to ship food, so there was no scarcity of food, but I appreciated that because between the time I got into the orphanage and I lived in a room somewhere with my brothers and sisters, we had no food. That\\'s what I  appreciated.  Yes, I had very good memories, very good memories, but I was bitter because I couldn\\'t--  I think I was bitter because I couldn\\'t imagine that I\\'ll ever be an orphan at one time. I used to know orphans, you know either the father died, or the mother died and they put  them in, but all of a sudden I had both gone, and what hurts me more is that I had a couple of sisters there. I don\\'t think the very young even knew that she didn\\'t have. There was a little girl, she must be four years old. She was taken in, but she was asking a little bit about her parents. That hurts me, but otherwise I think I was stronger at time. I took it the way it was, because I was very happy they took me into that orphanage. I already seen young kids going around and asking for bread, but whether I was happy or unhappy, I don\\'t know, but I appreciated being there.  I used to see him not very often because all of a sudden, my older sister was very knowledgeable -- my younger sister. But the rest of them, they were very young, they got involved in playing, involved in the procedure of the place. They had little girlfriends. That\\'s it.  I already told you it was run like a government. This guy, I didn\\'t see him very often I want you to know, but whenever I seen him, he was very lenient man. He if a kid was sick he would go by and pat him. He was very good, because I remember he even used to take out the excrement in the morning. He got up very early. I don\\'t remember him very well because I was a stranger down there. He figured that probably that I am not his in Polish they call it . He did not raise me, you understand? He more or less, he liked more the kids which he raised. Don\\'t forget that he was the kind of a man he read a lot of books which as I a child I was reading. Only of us children, all kinds of mysteries about how children behave and and we used to have theaters there too. We used to have what do you call , all kind of marionettes. In the beginning of the war you could do almost a lot of things, but the Germans were not organized yet. They couldn\\'t cope with a half a million Jews, and the Jews were not, at that time, segregated.  Tape #2  Other than seeing them go out, we were waiting for him a lot of times. He was busy  almost every day, going out and arranging for help. This orphanage was very organized. It was, I think at that time, it was even run by the Polish, by the city, but there were many, many orphanages at that time in Warsaw. I am going to run away from myself. That\\'s how we organized later when I had to leave. I haven\\'t got too many memories of that man because I was there only a short time. He would go around and check, ask if we had enough to eat maybe comfort me once in a while, say everything will work out, and the staff was very nice. The staff there understood that I was just a freshly baked orphan, so they were nice to me. They knew also that I had a brother, a little brother, my two sisters and so that\\'s all I remember.  Stephan, yes I saw her once in a while. An elderly lady who was very nice. That\\'s all I know, and I used to ask her how my little sisters are. She said don\\'t worry about them. They are fine. I used to come in and she\\'s show me the little children were dancing. I think my little one forgot all about my parents. She was involved in the life. The older  one --.  The best that I can recall I would say almost two months.  Then he organized, we must have organized it before, there was a place somewhere in Warsaw, in the Jewish district and they called that -- they took all the older boys down there all the freshly orphans which they took in, boys only, and they organized what they called a House of Boys, under their supervision, but they had a different administrator. That administrator was a professor, a Jewish professor. So, they took us, this guy would  and other guys who were approximately over 11 years old, and they organized a new home. This home was, again, they tried to get us to gover -- which you\\'ll see in this little book and it was very nice, I want you to know.  From what I remember, I did not remember, but my friend told me it was  Eventually they took a lot of boys off the street, too, and I would think I would say between 70, around there, 80. My little brother could have stayed with him, but he didn\\'t want to stay. He wanted to go with me. We were both there  It was completely different. The task of this place was we should be more or less responsible even economically for everything. They used to send children like to barbers where they cleaned up. They used to send people to shoemakers they should help. They used to send people out, the little older boys, because they were up to 15, 16, some of them even had a little children. Normally in Europe, if a kid finished school, he became an apprentice somewhere. So, people used to make money, kids used to make money and they would take the money and buy food. In other words, you almost had to be self sufficient.  I did all kinds of jobs. My first job was I worked with very responsible people who were directing the food distribution for all orphanages in Warsaw.  Jewish people, only in the Jewish district. I can\\'t tell you when it happened, but I can tell you what happened, because we at that point, a Ghetto, I mean were all together. Jews were separated, not completely yet, but they were separated. And we used to go out to all kinds of work. I worked with this -- he liked me this guy, and he directed the food distribution. He directed the people, had to hide whatever they had, the Germans would confiscate everything for free. So, they used to hide things in the cellars, wherever they could and then bring it up, because the American was already working there for orphanages, and I was there working. They used to bring all their wares, their samples and they would distribute all the samples. They didn\\'t give them any money, but they gave them certain numbers in Switzerland that later on they\\'ll be able to collect. Now, I know they never collected. But my job was . We used to - - we didn\\'t have any horses or anything, we used to have a little buggy, long buggy, one on the side and I on other side and we would pull from place to place and distribute food.  This I got so many bread. That was my first job. It lasted something like three months.  Then I had other jobs.  You keep asking me because the last job was the job where I could not come back to the  orphanage anymore.  It was more responsible. We were older kids. We were reading newspapers. And I want you to know, it went like a university. In this orphanage you had the biggest I would say doctors, the Germans as a rule tried to kill whether they were Poles or Jews all the intelligent, all the professors, doctors and colleges, all of them, so at this orphanage we had even though we knew who they were, but we had the very educated, most educated of Warsaw and surrounding. They were professors, they were the chief rabbis of a city called . They were they liked me, one guy wanted the best chore. There were other professors who were hiding there. They were cleaning, they were cooking in order not to be discovered by these Germans. And since they worked in orphanages, I don\\'t think the Germans checked too well. There were a few times they took out some. So, at night we were not allowed to go to school -- when night came after supper, what I know now how education goes, we had a terrific lectures on everything.  In other words, it was something like a university. All the boys would sit down and they would give us lectures in history, Jewish history and then they would always give us geography and any other arithmetic every other night another professor would start teaching us. Then the rabbi would teach us Judaism. It was like a university.  Very much. I wouldn\\'t miss those things. I couldn\\'t understand you know, I used to go to public school and I didn\\'t finish, so I couldn\\'t understand how nicely the interpreter was.  Yes it was on Gesha 6.  Those who were officially -- there was like people who worked there and they were also  very educated people because they tried to -- you had to a lot of influence to get off the street of Warsaw and work in orphanages. But at that same time they had to have a certain amount of education.  I really cannot recall names, but I know some of them didn\\'t even give their real names because they were hiding. They didn\\'t want to be killed by the Gestapo.  Why certainly, definitely. We were all Jewish kids and there was a chief rabbi down  there.  It was special. We maybe had a little more bread and we were singing the songs.  Not all of us. Those who had to work, and even some of them worked with the Germans outside the area and they had to go.  He supervised and he came by I would say very often. He would stop by and check with the and he would recognize us. He would check to see with they guys who were running it. He felt that this was his responsibility, because a lot of them other than me they were also his kids who were brought up by him.  I would say about a year and a half.  My little brother, too.  Oh yes. In fact, they used to bring new ones from the area, very nice educated kids, those who were qualified they brought into work.  I don\\'t know anything about before the war, but I\\'ll tell you they did not they couldn\\'t get into our place because the rooms, the area was very small and we had 30 40 people in a room. | don\\'t think they could absorb more but they did not have a place for them.  I have heard at that time that he was very influential even with the city who was catholic, but they respected him and I think he did open a few more somewhere. If he didn\\'t open officially, he took them off the streets.  Well, I would compare him to a hippie, I want you to know. He never dressed, you know, and he wasn\\'t really sophisticated. He was just like a hippie.  What they tried to do in this orphanage, they tried to make human beings out of us under the worst circumstances because inside we were like an island. Outside it was hell, a real hell. People were dying of starvation and even in the beginning they were dying of starvation, people some of their parents left for Russia, left the wife with the children. It was very bad outside. Here you tried to organize it in such a way that everyone either worked or if you couldn\\'t find work give him a trade inside. Little kids became shoe makers, cabinet makers. They brought up old tools.  Yes, and this was my downfall. I had other jobs where they used to send me I guess what happened is I wasn\\'t strong enough to pull the buggy so they sent me they had other jobs, to send me to people in factories where they were making clothes. But my last job, that was my downfall. That was my downfall. They sent me to a factory outside the Ghetto. I had to go at 5  Why certainly, at that time my name was , with a W. I figured I can\\'t keep my real name. I had to have a Polish name, a Christian Name, and they used to call me , So I didn\\'t know what to do. Where do you go? Finally, they were  asking, I went to another village. I already had a few dollars. The foreman gave me money. I was a polishing their boots, they had some horses, I was cleaning the horses, so I had quite a few marks at that time. So, I went to a small little village and then they had a sign. I stayed by people. They slept on the floor and they told me there\\'s a place where they\\'re looking for hands, working hands to help on the farm. And I have to go to the head of the area, who was naturally a German, a commandant and these people used to come and take the workers. They wanted them to have a lot of workers, because they were supplying food for the Germans. The Germans were confiscating food at that time. So, I came into a big place there, and I registered my name take a look I got working papers.'"
